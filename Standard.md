## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## 🏁 Hardware <a name = "hardware"></a>
List of Hardware: <br>
<h3> CPU: Intel i3 9100T (~40$ USD) </h3> <br>
</t> Intel LGA 1151 Chips are a good balance of efficiency while performant.  Unless you plan to use a GPU in your system, make sure to avoid F Series Chips. <br>
The intention is to utilize Quick Sync Video for Media Streaming transcoding. Any Intel Series 7, 8, or 9 chip should be sufficiently powerful for most needs. 


### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
